   --------------------- Open Numerical Library <T> -------------------------

General information
===================


This is OpenNL<T>, a library to easily construct and solve sparse linear systems.

* OpenNL<T> is supplied with a set of built-in iterative solvers 
   (Conjugate gradient and BICGSTAB)

* OpenNL can also use other solvers (by writing a SolverTraits class)

* ../lscm_with_generic_api.cpp implements the LSCM parameterization method with OpenNL<T>

Sorry, there is no more doc than that ...
